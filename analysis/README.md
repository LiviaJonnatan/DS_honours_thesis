# Analysis
This directory has Python scripts to:
- data cleaning
- data merging
  ([complete and merged data](https://ubcca-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/liviatan_student_ubc_ca/Documents/merge_complete.csv?d=w19032f73e111411baf81ac6281ed3843&csf=1&web=1&e=z55Ncu))
- data labelling (result based on [sensor data](https://ubcca-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/liviatan_student_ubc_ca/ER3XiFe8OiBPn4_YUbjysbAB-19A9NphYET1pkUPWEMOew?e=wLfmLx) and [R algorithm](https://ubcca-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/liviatan_student_ubc_ca/Eab4dZyuRPNCs3BtAm0j3IIBQ-nzSAqkjhBbSLbOQS4sHg?e=zRMXRl))
- compare result from previouly existing R algorithm and sensor data
- calculate step difference ([final CSV file](https://ubcca-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/liviatan_student_ubc_ca/ET56VKP9zcZJnKnVvemlPNwBOYngR4W8X9PkyqLg22MQMA?e=rx1USi) for machine learning)
- supervised machine learning
  - classification tree
  - naive Bayes
  - K-nearest neighbors
  - logistic regression
  - linear discriminant analysis
  - support vector machines (linear, polynomial, radial basis function)
- exploring and plotting bovine steps
- principal component analysis, followed by mentioned supervised learning algorithms

P.S. "genome" and "sensor" are used interchangably, but refer to the same thing (sensor data)
