- data cleaning
- data merging
  ([complete and merged data](https://ubcca-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/liviatan_student_ubc_ca/Documents/merge_complete.csv?d=w19032f73e111411baf81ac6281ed3843&csf=1&web=1&e=z55Ncu))
- data labelling (based on [sensor data](https://ubcca-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/liviatan_student_ubc_ca/ER3XiFe8OiBPn4_YUbjysbAB-19A9NphYET1pkUPWEMOew?e=wLfmLx) and [R algorithm](https://ubcca-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/liviatan_student_ubc_ca/Eab4dZyuRPNCs3BtAm0j3IIBQ-nzSAqkjhBbSLbOQS4sHg?e=zRMXRl))
- comparing result from previouly existing R algorithm and sensor data
- step difference calculation
- supervised learning

P.S. "genome" and "sensor" are used interchangably, but refer to the same thing (sensor data)
