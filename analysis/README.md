# Analysis
This directory has Python scripts to:
- data cleaning
- data merging
  ([complete and merged data](https://ubcca-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ramon_lawrence_ubc_ca/EVlzmtK_lwxDu2eAxZYz7m8BcYvZOeW8XBjcVKqUKDy0ig?e=6mmpRd))
- data labelling (result based on [sensor data](https://ubcca-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ramon_lawrence_ubc_ca/ET_fUww-dZFOhhGSWkj6j8EBhy0SnBYNT3FfkQEPO8Q0cg?e=85pcqo) and [R algorithm](https://ubcca-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ramon_lawrence_ubc_ca/ET66Wrn7qEVMv1cWQJev0UsByvyBp9ktxXFyCaiuQRK9Ig?e=UxSioL)
- compare result from previouly existing R algorithm and sensor data
- calculate step difference ([final CSV file](https://ubcca-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ramon_lawrence_ubc_ca/ERiZ10VBu-dBifB2QkEx1W4BFJVrlMUV-xKKRLRliMv6zg?e=5Qjnc1) for machine learning)
- supervised machine learning
  - classification tree
  - naive Bayes
  - K-nearest neighbors
  - logistic regression
  - linear discriminant analysis
  - support vector machines (linear, polynomial, radial basis function)
- exploring and plotting bovine steps
- principal component analysis, followed by mentioned supervised learning algorithms

P.S. "genome" and "sensor" are used interchangably, but refer to the same thing (sensor data)
